# Cookies Receipe

## Ingredients for the cookies

-1 cup white whole wheat pastry flour (I used Bob's Red Mill) (can also substitute 1 cup all-purpose flour)
-1 cup light (or medium) brown sugar
-1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, melted
-1 egg
-1 teaspoon vanilla extract
-1/2 teaspoon baking soda
-1/2 teaspoon salt
-1 teaspoon cornstarch
-1 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips


## Instructions

1. Melt the butter in a medium bowl. Stir in sugar, egg, vanilla extract, baking soda, salt, and cornstarch until combined. Fold in flour, stirring until just combined. Fold in chocolate chips. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or overnight.
2.Once dough has chilled, preheat the oven to 350°F. Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper or a silpat. Using a 1/4 cup cookie scoop, scoop the cookies onto the cookie sheet, leaving at least 1 1/2 inches in between each dough ball. Depending on the size of your cookie sheet, you may have to bake two batches.
3.Place in oven for roughly 12 minutes, until the cookie edges begin to turn golden brown. Allow to cool completely before assembling cookie sandwiches.
4.While the cookies are cooling, make the frosting. In a standing mixer, whip the butter and brown sugar together until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Add in all of the remaining ingredients besides the chocolate chips and mix on medium-high speed until combined. Depending on the consistency, you may need more or less heavy cream. Add a tablespoon at a time until desired consistency is reached. Remove from mixer and fold in chocolate chips with a spatula.
5.Assemble your cookie sandwiches by spooning frosting onto the bottom of one cookie, then placing another bottom on the other side. Eat & enjoy!
